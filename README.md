Smart Waste System (GIS & Kobo Survey Project)
I decided to work on a GIS-based waste management project in Ngong Town, Kajiado County. My goal was to identify illegal dumping sites and waste collection gaps using mobile data collection and spatial analysis. I designed a Kobo Toolbox survey to capture GPS coordinates, waste type, size, environmental risks, and photo evidence. The collected data was analyzed in QGIS and visualized in Google Earth to support evidence-based decision making.
